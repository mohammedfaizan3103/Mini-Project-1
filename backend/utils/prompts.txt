1. PROMPT NUMBER 1 WITHOUT TASK LIST
const prompt = `
Generate a detailed and easy-to-display performance review based on the following task data:

**Current week:**
- Tasks completed: ${current.tasks_completed}
- Tasks delayed: ${current.tasks_delayed}
- Average delay: ${current.average_delay_hours} hours
- Urgent tasks: ${current.urgent_tasks}
- Delayed urgent tasks: ${current.delayed_urgent_tasks}

**Previous week:**
- Tasks completed: ${previous.tasks_completed}
- Tasks delayed: ${previous.tasks_delayed}

**Task Categories:**
- urgent_important: Critical tasks with significant impact.
- urgent_not_important: Immediate but low-impact tasks.
- not_urgent_important: High-impact but flexible tasks.
- not_urgent_not_important: Low-priority and flexible tasks.

---

### **Instructions:**

1. **Generate Insights:**
   - Compare this week's performance with the previous week.
   - Highlight key trends in task completion, delays, and overall productivity.
   - Identify patterns specific to the provided categories (e.g., are more urgent tasks being delayed?).
   - Provide **clear, concise insights** relevant to the current and previous week.

2. **Pattern Detection:**
   - Detect if certain categories (urgent, important, etc.) have **more frequent delays** or lower completion rates.
   - Identify recurring issues across weeks, such as:
     - Consistent delays in certain categories.
     - Frequent postponement of important but not urgent tasks.
     - Neglect of lower-priority tasks.

3. **Missed Tasks Summary (Text-Based):**
   - Generate a **short, readable summary** describing the missed tasks.
   - Include the **number of missed tasks by category** (urgent, important, etc.).
   - Highlight which categories are most frequently delayed.
   - Keep the summary clear and easy to display.

4. **Improvement Areas:**
   - Provide **2-4 specific, actionable suggestions** based on the current trends.
   - Tailor the suggestions to the categories, e.g.:
     - If urgent tasks are frequently missed → Suggest better prioritization.
     - If not urgent but important tasks are neglected → Recommend time-blocking strategies.
     - Suggest delegation or simplification if low-impact tasks are taking too much time.

  }
}

2. PROMPT NUMBER 2 WITH TASK LIST
const prompt = `
Generate a detailed and easy-to-display performance review based on the following task data:

---

### **Current week:**
- Tasks completed: ${current.tasks_completed}
- Tasks delayed: ${current.tasks_delayed}
- Average delay: ${current.average_delay_hours} hours
- Urgent tasks: ${current.urgent_tasks}
- Delayed urgent tasks: ${current.delayed_urgent_tasks}

---

### **Previous week:**
- Tasks completed: ${previous.tasks_completed}
- Tasks delayed: ${previous.tasks_delayed}

---

### **Task Categories:**
- urgent_important: Critical tasks with significant impact.
- urgent_not_important: Immediate but low-impact tasks.
- not_urgent_important: High-impact but flexible tasks.
- not_urgent_not_important: Low-priority and flexible tasks.

---

### **Task List:**
Analyze the following list of tasks. Identify patterns, common issues, and improvement areas based on the task names, categories, and completion status.

\`\`\`json
${JSON.stringify(taskData.tasks, null, 2)}
\`\`\`

---

### **Instructions:**

1. **Generate Insights Based on Tasks:**
   - Compare this week's performance with the previous week.
   - Identify key trends in task completion, delays, and overall productivity.
   - Detect **patterns in task names**:
     - Identify if certain types of tasks (based on recurring keywords) are frequently delayed.
     - Highlight categories with consistent delays.
   - Summarize **specific insights** related to the task list.

2. **Pattern Detection:**
   - Detect **recurring issues** based on the task content.
   - Identify common themes in delayed or frequently missed tasks (e.g., meetings, reports, approvals).
   - Group tasks by category and analyze the most frequently delayed or missed categories.

3. **Missed Tasks Summary (Text-Based):**
   - Generate a **short, readable summary** describing the missed tasks.
   - Include the **number of missed tasks by category**.
   - Mention specific task names or common task types in the summary.
   - Make the summary concise and easy to display.

4. **Improvement Areas:**
   - Provide **2-4 actionable suggestions** based on task patterns.
   - Make the suggestions specific and practical:
     - If recurring types of tasks are frequently delayed → Suggest prioritization or scheduling strategies.
     - If a specific category is neglected → Recommend more dedicated time blocks or delegation strategies.
     - If urgent but low-impact tasks are over-consuming time → Recommend task batching or delegation.
